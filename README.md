# opencv_cmake_template
Minimal CMake Project Structure for OpenCV on Linux
Tested with OpenCV 4.2 on Ubuntu 20.04 but should work in most enviroments

To use, first clone respository or create a new one using the template and clone, then in the project directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
